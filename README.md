# Big Data with example and types

**Big data:**
Data which is very huge and complex, generating with high velocity of different varieties (images, text, videos etc) which need to be processed for the further usage.

**Examples:**
Big data in healthcare, sports, social media, IOT , aerospace etc.

## Big data in healthcare:

Big data collects the data from different patients through EHR(electronic health records), find the patterns in the patient data, it creates the machine learning models that predicts the patient health conditions, for instance it takes the input as the patient details like haemoglobin levels, glucose etc and finds the type of disease. 


## Big data in sports: 

Big data collects the data from the players through sensors and finds the player heart beat, his speed in running etc also finds the speed of the ball also used to give the decisions based on the LBW etc. it creates the machine learning model and predicts the win percentage of the game, aspects of the player etc.

## Big data types:

1. **Batch:** batch data processing refers to the collecting of data in the means of batches. It is used for the analysis of non-real time data. It is used in financial reports for business analyst, used to manage inventory sales in manufacturing.

2. **Streaming:** streaming data refers to the generation of data continuously in the real time and to be processed immediately as it arrives. It is used in fraud detection as it triggers alerts immediately when unusual activities are done.

3. **Graph:** graph data refers to relation between the data entities(nodes) and connections (edges) which represents the graph model. It analyses the complex relationship between many entities. It is used in the social network analysis to find the relation between users and used In recommendation systems by analysing user activities.

4. **Spatio - temporal:** spatio - temporal refers to data that comprises of both spatial(location based) and temporal(time based). It analyses the data that comes from spatial and temporal. It is used in GPS and location tracking to track the movement of vehicles and used to forecast the climatic change in environmental monitoring.







## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each)

1. **VOLUME:** the volume is defined as the amount or size of data which is used to store, manage and process for our needs in the organization.It requires specialized tools and technologies to extract, process the huge volumes of datasets in the big data.
Example: Facebook is storing many posts, images etc.

2. **VELOCITY:** velocity is defined as the the rate of speed of the data which is generated, collected and processed for the further usage. It requires various strategies to handle the constant flow of data for the decision making analysis.
Example: Facebook users are uploading more than 5 million photos per day.

3. **VARIETY:** variety is defined as the diversity of data types and formats that arising while dealing with the complex datasets. It requires various data management and analysis tools to extract useful information.
Example: Facebook generates different varieties of data such as text, images, videos etc.

4. **VARIABILITY:** variability is defines as the irregularities in the data patterns over the time. It requires various data preprocessing, analysis techniques to ensure the extracted data is accurate and reliable.
Example: weather data exhibits variability of data by changing rapidly on various factors like temperature, humidity, etc.

5. **VERACITY:** veracity is defined as the importance of data quality, reliability, consistency on the data. It requires various validation, analysis tools to ensure the data is accurate and consistency for the decision making.
Example: Facebook has got many challenges interms of fake news where it removes all the

6 **VALUE:** value is defined as the benefit results that organisations derive by analysing the data collected.it is the last v of the big data. It is the combination of all the v’s in big data which gives the successful product to the outside world.
Example: Amazon company leverages big data analytics to provide better shopping experience to the customers.

## Phases of Big Data analysis 

Big Data involves several phases  to extract meaningful data from the complex datasets. They are,

1. **ACQUISITION:** Data acquisition is the process of collecting oh huge volumes and different varieties of data from different sources like data bases, social media platforms like Facebook, twitter, IOT devices etc. The data collected from the sources is very high in size like petabytes. So extracting the meaningful data is very difficult, hence filters are made to remove the unnecessary data and retrieve useful data.

2. **Cleaning and Extraction:** in this phase, the useful data is retrieved from different sources and used it for further processing. Cleaning is made to avoid the outliers, remove the errors in the data and fix the issues in the data. Various ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) tools are used to extract and clean the data.
3.Integration and representation: here the inconsistency, duplicates are removed from the data which is combined and aggregated from the different sources and the data is used for visualisation by various methods like histograms, charts and some other tools like power BI and Tableau.

4. **Data Modelling and analysis:** in this phase, structure and relationships are standardised between the data through various data modelling tools like Lucid chart, Rapid miner etc, also the data is analysed by applying various machine learning algorithms by building models and hypothesis testing to extract the useful data.

5. **Interpretation:** this is the last phase of the big data where result are shown up by interpreting and examining the assumptions made in analysis and is set for decision making. Here the user follows the ethical considerations such as fairness, transparency etc.

## Challenges in Big Data analysis :

1. **Heteroginity and incompleteness:**


Heterogeneity: heterogeneity means of different type, as the big data contains the data in different formats like texts, pdfs, images, videos etc. machine learning algorithms works best with the homogeneous data, so handling with this type of type data is very difficult as does fit for machine learning models.

Incompleteness: the big data require various cleaning, though the errors cannot be removes, some of gaps and inconsistencies also present which makes the data unreliable for decision making arising to data incompleteness.

Scale:Data volume is the major issue as the data is generated in the huge volumes daily, so to store such large and complex data normal computing is very difficult, hence utilizing the cloud computing is the best way to overcome this issue, so the data processing speed is increased.

Timeliness:In big data, the data need to be analysed very quickly in the real time projects.In the social media, stock marketing quick reactions are needed, also in the search engines, to find the data items in the complex datasets, indexing strategies are required.





Privacy:The usage of big data is increased, hence there is a rise in privacy concern. Many complex datasets contain many peoples sensitive information which caused damage to the privacy concern.this is both technical and social problem. It is major issue to conserve data between privacy and data sharing to the further process.

Human Collaboration:Big data is comprised of both human skills and computational analysis for a efficient decision making. When it comes to the managing errors, humans may make mistakes intentionally or unintentionally in crowd - sourced data, hence quality control measure like cross validation should be introduced to correct the errors over Time.
